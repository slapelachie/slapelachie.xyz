Updates","server-backend-updates","Server Backend Updates","home-network-changes","Home-network changes",2,"root","h2","Over the past few weeks I have been changing the way content is deployed on my server.\nThe most obvious change I have made is this blog, where I have written my own custom theme, and begun writing these posts in org-mode.\nHowever, in the background I have changed the back-end from using regular services installed directly to my server to instead using docker to containerize everything on the server.\nAlong with this I have also changed a lot with my home network.","Even though this was changed a while ago I still thing there is some merit into talking about it.\nThe design I have went for is a clean old type of website without any excess javascript or styling, this is to help load times and prevent there from being any unneeded bloat.\nWith the typography being in monospace, the content of the website is clear and easy to read.\nWith the website being so minimal, it is a lot easier to maintain and has minimal, if any security flaws that most modern websites suffer with.","I decided to redesign this blog page to match my ","https:\u002F\u002Fslapelachie.xyz",".\nAs with the homepage, the blog has a light footprint and generates the needed pages quickly due to the low file size and amount of all the extra CSS needed.\nThe theme lacks a lot of what other themes have, but for the use of this blog I believe that this does not matter.\nI have also rewritten the main pages in org-mode using emacs.\nThis has made it easier and a lot easier to see the final result of the page within just emacs, due to the live preview of org-mode files built-in with emacs.","As stated earlier, I have changed my backend from using services to dockerized containers.\nThis took quite a while as I needed to learn how to utilize ","https:\u002F\u002Fdoc.traefik.io\u002Ftraefik\u002F","traefik"," for my reverse proxy, with some needing more work than others.\nSwitching to docker was a pain, and it is considerably more bloated, however it makes maintenance and keeping my services up to date a lot more easier.","Around this time I noticed my mail server wasn't working, and it hadn't been working for quite some time.\nTo this day I still have no idea what caused the mail server to stop working, but my suspicions are with the certificates.\nTo make matters worse, during this time cron had been sending me emails every minute on a failing task, in the end I had around 107k emails sent to the mail box.","Like the server, I had changed my home server to also run docker containers instead of the services I had running.\nThis allowed me to also utilize ","https:\u002F\u002Fpi-hole.net\u002F","pi-hole"," in a container, allowing me to register network ride cname's and DNS entrys that are not possible on my modem.","I have also recently bought myself an actual home server.\nThe server in question is a Dell R610, which came with no ram or hard disks installed.\nWhen the server is setup, it should be a good replacement for my current server, a Dell Optiplex 9020.\nIt will also give me room to play around with server grade hardware and improve my skills with such."))
