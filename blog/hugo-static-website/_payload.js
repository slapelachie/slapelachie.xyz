While this is useful in some instances - such as creating a forum or a website with a large user base - these frameworks are taking over what should be very minimal websites and making them bloated.\nAs I like creating things that are light-weight and only have the necessities, I decided to seek alternatives, which is where I stumbled upon statically generated websites.","This option is combination of both dynamic and static websites, where the server generates the pages from templates and then serves them as static websites that do not need to be generated on the fly.","For my use case - a simple blog - this is perfect for the following reasons:","ol","It's secure - I don't need to log in through a terribly created authentication system and just need to upload it to the server.","It's fast - The server does not need apply the template whenever someone visits the website.","Ease of use - I just need to upload a simple markdown document and execute a command to get a new post to show up.","So, why did I choose to use Hugo for this.\nWell the answer is simple, it's the first one I found.\nCoincidentally it matches my needs perfectly, all I need to do is find a good template, modify it a bit, and then start posting with it.","This is not a guide, this is just the process on how I set it up for my own use.\nFor a proper guide I would suggest looking at Hugo's ","https:\u002F\u002Fgohugo.io\u002Fdocumentation","documentation",", Lunduke's "," or Chris Titus' ","https:\u002F\u002Fchristitus.com\u002Fhugo-guide\u002F","guide","Reading into how to create websites using Hugo, I stumbled across a "," by Lunduke, which suggested to download the binary from Hugo's ","https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fgohugoio\u002Fhugo\u002Freleases","github"," and place it in the project directory (This was better for me as I did not need to worry about adding more packages to my testing machine).","After doing this I followed through the documentation and how to create the website and installing the themes.
